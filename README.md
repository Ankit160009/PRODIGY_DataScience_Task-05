# Learning Data Science at Prodigy InfoTech

Welcome to my GitHub repository, a digital chronicle of my internship learning journey at Prodigy InfoTech. Here, you'll find Jupyter notebooks like `Task_05.ipynb`, which contain the tasks I've been assigned, along with my solutions and learnings.

## Repository Contents

- `Task_05.ipynb`: A notebook detailing the task provided by Prodigy InfoTech, along with my exploratory data analysis, insights, and predictive models.

## Learning Objectives

The main objective of this repository is to track my growth and development as a Data Science Intern. It serves as a platform where I can reflect on my experiences, consolidate knowledge, and share my discoveries with the broader community.

## Technologies Used

In these projects, I leverage:
- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and others for advanced data processing and visualization.

## Reflections on Learning

With each task, I encounter new challenges and opportunities to learn. This repository is not just about showcasing completed workâ€”it's about the process of learning, adapting, and overcoming obstacles in the data science landscape.

## Engage and Contribute

I'm eager to receive feedback, suggestions, and questions. Feel free to fork this repository, open issues for discussion, or reach out with your thoughts. Let's make this a collaborative learning experience.
